# Family Tree Viewer

This is an interactive family tree visualizer built using [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/). Each person is a node in a directed graph, and relationships like partnerships and children are represented by edges. Clicking a person shows their details in a popup. It also includes a search box to quickly find people by name.

## üõ†Ô∏è Editing the Tree

Each person in `people.json` must have:
```
{
  "id": "p1",
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "dob": "01/01/1950",
  "image": "img/p1.jpg",
  "notes": "Some <strong>HTML</strong> is okay",
  "children": []
}
```
Unions (marriages or partnerships) use:
```
{
  "id": "u1",
  "invisible": true,
  "children": ["p2", "p3"]
}
```

## Images
If no image is provided, img/non.jpg is used by default. You can add your own images to the img/ folder and reference them in people.json.
